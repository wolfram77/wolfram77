### Harsh Realities!

> It is possible to make no mistake and still lose. It's also possible to royally mess things up and still win. [(REF)][01reddit]

> Hard work won't guarentee a thing. But without it, you don't stand a chance. [(REF)][01reddit]

> Life is not fair. Expecting it to be will always disappoint you. [(REF)][01reddit]

> Life is not automatically easier just because you are a good person. Having a moral compass and being a good person usually means you have a line in the sand somewhere, and there will always be someone who is always willing to go further than you, undercut you, or outcompete you. [(REF)][01reddit]

> The only get rich quick scheme that works is selling get rich quick schemes. [(REF)][02tfoot]

> Okay, gotta go. Off to the gym, then dinner, then home, then bed. [(REF)][05wbwhy]

> Statistics don't lie, but liars use statistics. [(REF)][06agold]

> He who loses his money is forsaken by his friends, his wife, his servants and his relations; yet when he regains his riches those who have forsaken him come back to him. Hence wealth is certainly the best of relations. [(REF)][07chank]

> A person should not be too honest. Straight trees are cut first and honest people are screwed first. [(REF)][07chank]

> Even if a snake is not poisonous, it should pretend to be venomous. [(REF)][07chank]

> Virtuous persons and fruit-laden trees bow, but fools and dry sticks break because they do not bend. [(REF)][07chank]

> Low class men desire wealth; middle class men both wealth and respect; but the noble, honour only; hence honour is the noble man's true wealth. [(REF)][07chank]
