### Ideas and Psychology

My goal is to be an innovator, and keep the world a liveable place to live in. I work with both hardware and software tools, and consider failure as a setback. A research programme provides me with learning and experience for undertaking small-scale engineering projects and helps me understand the world I live in. Earlier I worked with Indian Food Composition Portal, and learned about health and nutrition. I guess robotics can solve health and nutrition problems on earth.

#### The Boiling Frog Syndrome

What happens when you put a frog in boiling water? It jumps out of course. But what happens when you put the frog in tepid water & slowly increase the heat? Something unexpected. The frog doesn’t realise what’s going on and eventually boils to its death.

Now while there is no scientific backing for the boiling frog story, it’s used to point out that gradual changes go unnoticed until they become too monumental & cause a significant effect. And many businesses who fail to take note and adapt to the times often die the frog’s death. [(REF)][01finsh]

#### Reasons for a Farm Cooperative

"Stop mentally blaming the world for your misfortune, buckle up and explore new opportunities (there are some within your reach no matter how you find yourself currently), while not betting on one single thing."

I would agree to this statement except that these opportunities are not equally available to all. Worse our society is highly tolerant to certain privileged people making enormous mistakes while we penalize marginal people for simple ones. To be concrete, lets take the example of corporate debt and farmer suicides. Corporations that have 1000s of crores of debt are allowed to continue while we penalize farmers who are not able to pay back even small amounts of loan to even consider self harm. So we require marginal people to be super smart while privileged people can take things for granted. There are plenty of examples of this Winners Takes All phenomenon if you look around.

We should be optimistic and make the best of our current situation. At the same time, we should understand the inequalities in opportunities, and give second chances to people who deserve it.
