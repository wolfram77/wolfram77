Subhajit Sahu is pursuing a doctorate degree in Computer Science and Engineering (Spring 2019 - ongoing) with [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~kkishore/) as his thesis advisor, at [Center for Security, Theory, and Algorithmic Research (CSTAR)](https://cstar.iiit.ac.in), IIIT Hyderabad, India - 500 032. His research is in the design of [Efficient Dynamic Graph algorithms for Social Networks that leverage parallelism available on modern architectures](https://puzzlef.github.io). He has obtained a [CGPA](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c9goUgwXkyhsWIOc873RDhTk7nEs-hJ5/view?usp=sharing) of `8.4` out of `10`.

Before pursuing [PhD at IIIT Hyderabad](https://iiithf.github.io), Subhajit has worked at Qualcomm Hyderabad in debugging of Android Graphics driver, and at Verizon Hyderabad in upgrading of Cell Site Manager portal and design of [RFID-based Snacks automation system](https://github.com/raspberrypif/rfid). During his undergraduate studies in [Electronics and Communication Engineering at NIT Rourkela](https://nitrece.github.io), he has designed a [Wireless Sensor Node for Flood monitoring](https://github.com/nitrece/flood-monitoring) as his Final year project, interned at NUS Singapore where he worked on [Wireless data acquisition for NUS Smart Grid](https://github.com/nitrece/smart-grid-monitoring) and Visualization for an Underwater ROV, and interned at Tata Elxsi Bangalore where he worked on the design of Upsampler and Downsampler filters for a communication system. Subhajit also contributes [Open source software](https://nodef.github.io/). He has designed a [Natural Language Query portal for Indian Food Composition 2017](https://github.com/ifct2017/ifct2017), a simplified [Facade API for FYERS Securities](https://github.com/nodef/extra-fyers), [Array](https://github.com/nodef/extra-array) and [String](https://github.com/nodef/extra-string) manipulation utilities, and a [CLI for nvGraph](https://github.com/nodef/nvgraph.sh). At St. Paul's School, he made a number of programs with [QuickBASIC in DOS](https://qb40.github.io).
