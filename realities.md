### Harsh Realities!

> It is possible to make no mistake and still lose. It's also possible to royally mess things up and still win.

> Hard work won't guarentee a thing. But without it, you don't stand a chance.

> Life is not fair. Expecting it to be will always disappoint you.

> Life is not automatically easier just because you are a good person. Having a moral compass and being a good person usually means you have a line in the sand somewhere, and there will always be someone who is always willing to go further than you, undercut you, or outcompete you.

> The only get rich quick scheme that works is selling get rich quick schemes.
